        <h3>1.5 Copyright</h3>
        <p>
            Copyright gives a person ownership over whatever original work they create including but not limited to: films, music, art & literary works among other eligible work creations. Generally a copyright prevents work from being copied or shared without the original copyright owner’s consent; this doesn’t mean a work can’t be copied or shared at all though.
        </p>
        <p>
            If someone wants to share or otherwise copy a piece of copyrighted work they must get the copyright owners permission otherwise they will commit copyright infringement. The way this affects websites means that a website when published to the internet should not have any copyrighted material that has been used without consent. The usual way to get around this is to simply use material that isn’t copyrighted and is free to use without asking for permission. Notably you do not have to file for copyright as an idea is automatically protected when it is committed to a fixed form such as paper.[1]
