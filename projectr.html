        <h3>3.1 IT Benefits & Drawbacks</h3>
        <p>
            The tools had various benefits and drawbacks to them. Google Docs is useful for creating documents and working from anywhere which is useful for working from home or making small edits without having to go to another location. Google Docs only works with an internet connection meaning that if there is no internet available or there is an unreliable connection it can interfere with work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trello was useful for gauging what needs to be done for documentation work, but was difficult to utilise when tracking code development. I could have been more efficient with Trello by setting myself specific coding tasks instead of thinking of what I wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code was critical for developing the code for my website and could use multiple coding languages meaning it could work for both the content of the site and the layout/design of the website. VSC didn’t have any sort of regular spell checker so writing text was best done in another program and then copied into VSC rather than use VSC directly.

        <h3>3.2 Productvity & Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
            Listed below are some ways in which I could’ve been more productive and efficient when working on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the ways I could have been more productive was assigning myself proper tasks to complete when creating code. Trello would have been put to better use and I may have been able to work quicker and better if I set some coding goals for myself instead of just working on what seemed to be needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could have been more efficient when creating the navigation bar for my website by completing it fully for a single page then copying the result to every other page instead of adding to each page whenever I created a new webpage. I could also make ways to remind myself to frequently update Trello.

        <h3>3.3 Productivity Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            If I were to do another project like this again I would likely do it in a team as it would allow for tasks to be given to different people and make it clear what I would need to do rather than look at what I’ve done and try to guess from there. Working in a team would also allow for an easier time asking for help or clarification on problems or questions especially when using a communication tool like Slack.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>3.4 Testing Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            If I were to test the solution of working in a team I would likely set up a project and team, including myself, to create a website using the tools I used, and whatever other tools worked well, and record the teams progress along with what worked well and what areas could use improvement at the end of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I couldn’t get a team together I could try making another website for practice and placing a reminder, either in a document or physical note, to update Trello or check what tasks I will need to do. It would also work well to define early on what tasks will be necessary for making a website so I can easily add cards to Trello instead of thinking them up as I do them.
