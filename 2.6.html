        <h3>1.6 Access Issues</h3>
        <p>
            Access issues refers to the issues that a person may have when accessing a website. While this is applicable to most people there are different requirements that must be met for those with specific disabilities. Small text can be difficult to read for people with poor eyesight so making the text on a page large enough for them to read easily without cluttering up the page should be considered when designing a website.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Making buttons and other clickable links larger is helpful to anyone who accesses the website as making the button larger makes it easier to click. Colour blindness can also affect a person's ability to access a website. When making a website or page that is dependent on colour either choose a colour scheme that can work with known forms of colour blindness or make it so that it isnâ€™t dependent on colour and use an alternate method instead.
