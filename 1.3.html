        <h3>1.3 Planning out Tasks</h3>
        <p>
            Regarding my assignment tasks I will be using Trello to manage and plan out my tasks. As mentioned earlier in this document, Trello is an online Kanban styled management app which allows for easy management of work tasks either individually or in a group. [3]

            Using Trello will be very convenient for me as it allows me to keep track of my tasks and update them as needed, whilst making it easy to tell what tasks correspond to which section of the design I am making. Being able to access Trello from any computer device also means I have the option of working from home if I so choose to or if I need to make minute adjustments to any of my work and would rather get it done before the next day. Link to my Trello board can be found in the references section. [4]
