        <h3>1.2 Methods, Resources & Skills</h3>
        <p>
            A digital project requires various methods, resources and skills to be utilised in order to be successful and there are many to learn and use. Managing time and tasks is important so methods like Kanban can be used to properly allocate tasks to multiple people and update those tasks as necessary to keep people on track. [2]
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst workflow methods like Kanban can be used on a physical surface like a whiteboard, a similar effect can be achieved with the use of various online tools. A good example of one of these tools would be Trello as it allows cards to be placed on various lists showing what tasks are available, the status of each task and who the task has been assigned to. Tools like Trello allow for tasks to be assigned without having to gather an entire team physically to hand them out and tasks can be updated quickly by the team individually. There are many different tools which can aid in various different areas of a project, not just Trello.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of helpful workflow methods and useful tools a team also needs various skills to be able to use their IT technologies effectively. Notably an employee should know how to use basic functions of a computer and any applications they may be using. Knowing how to conduct research will also be an invaluable skill as it allows an employee to discover information that may not be immediately available and knowing what to search for and where to find it is very useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping all of the above in mind there are many methods to experiment with, tools to acquire and skills to learn for a modern business employee, but, utilising all of these together will allow for a business to flourish and grow.
