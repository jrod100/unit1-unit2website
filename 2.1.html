        <h3>1.1 Content Layout</h3>
        <p>
            I have attempted to make a consistent theme and layout for my website and have explained the layout and contents of the overall site in the text below. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of each page is the unit and outcome numbers with a navigation bar between pages directly beneath it. Beneath the navigation bar is the question number to the relevant question and text within bordered boxes and additional subheadings for multiple questions and sections where relevant. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating the ‘About Me’ and ‘Technology Analysis’ pages I added images after each paragraph to help illustrate specific points or show the logos of mentioned tech apps. On pages with references I have put the references in a differently styled box and linked the references to the relevant webpages. The overall layout has remained consistent throughout development and the end result is aesthetically pleasing.
