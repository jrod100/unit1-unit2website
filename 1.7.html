        <h3>1.7 Legal Guidelines & Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the “primary law regulating how companies protect EU citizens personal data”. [6] Since the UK left the EU via Brexit the UK will be subject to a similar regulation once the withdrawal agreement officially ends with the new regulation being called  the UK-GDPR.  Until the withdrawal agreement ends the UK will still have the GDPR apply to them. [7] As both laws are effectively the same just covering different locations this document will look at the regular GDPR specifically since it still affects the UK at the time of writing.

            To oversimplify the GDPR, it allows people to have more control over their personal information and restrict what organisations are able to do with a persons’ information. Notably organisations must request a consumer to comply to terms and services before signing up for something and give a consumer a choice in whether their data is used for marketing or if they want to receive marketing form the organisation. The rights the GDPR provides consumers also applies to an organisations employees among others so an employee may not have their information shared without their permission among other rights. [8]
