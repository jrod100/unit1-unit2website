        <h3>2.1 IT Tools Review</h3>
        <p>
            Multiple different tools were used to create my website including Trello and Visual Studio Code, in the following section, I have reviewed the tools usefulness in creating my website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code (VSC) was the tool used to create the code for the website. VSC was highly useful and was simple for me to use as adding in details wasn’t overly complicated and creating the layout was simple. Utilising HTML & CSS was incredibly useful for making my website and wasn’t too difficult for me to pick up as a new learner of both coding languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trello was mostly useful for keeping track of my documentation related tasks as it allowed me to create cards ahead of time and update Trello when I believed i was done. When creating my website I didn’t think to create set tasks for myself and had to add cards in after I’d finished as I didn’t think to Trello to track my creation progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            When typing up answers to questions I used Google Docs as the main documentation tool. Google Docs was highly useful as it allowed me to store my work in a place where I could work on it from anywhere and came with a spell checker making it easy to type up my question answers and then add them to VSC for the website.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2.2 IT Tools Utility</h3>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code was a necessary tool to utilise if I wanted to create my website. VSC was up to date making it an appropriate tool for coding and website creation. Trello was an appropriate tool to use for managing my tasks and their status regarding how complete they were, though, It wasn’t utilised to its fullest utility during the coding process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google Docs was an appropriate tool to use for documentation as it allowed me to type up answers to the questions I was given and came with the usual spell checker and document creation functions that I might/would require. An added bonus is that I could work on these documents from any computer with an internet connection meaning I would be able to work on these documents from home if necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            My website has many strengths to its design. Each page has a consistent layout and general design as the background is the same colour and the text remains consistent in size and colour. The links to each page are clearly visible and each page works as intended meaning that nobody can get stuck on a single page.
        </p>
        <p>
            A weakness of my website is that not every page has an image so certain points aren’t as emphasized as they could be. The colour scheme looks good to me but I can’t be certain that it is generally appealing to the majority of people who would visit it. Overall though I’m quite pleased with the end result though I might add a few more images or change the colour scheme if I wanted to improve it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2.4 Further Improvements</h3>
        <p>
            Carrying on from the previous section, I would add more images where relevant to help emphasize or demonstrate various points made in the text. I would also utilise CSS Flexbox to make my website more technically impressive and visually pleasing to look at. I would also make more effective use of Trello such as setting myself specific tasks for my coding tasks to aid in keeping me on task and remind myself of what needs to be done or what could be improved.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
            Multiple outcomes were set for the creation of my website and I believe i have managed to meet them with how I created my website. My website contains relevant and appropriate content as  defined in Unit 2 Outcome 2.1’Preparing appropriate content for your site‘.
        </p>
        <p>
            I achieved this as there is nothing inappropriate on my webpages and the images I used fit with what is being said. I have used Visual Studio Code for editing and formatting my website as defined in Unit 2 Outcome 2.3 ‘Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation’ with the navigation bar on each page achieving the good navigation requirement and the obvious labels and consistent layout achieving the clarity requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally for Unit 2 Outcome 2.6: ‘Error free pages that are fit to purpose’ my pages don’t have any errors and are objectively fit for their purpose as each page holds only relevant information and text regarding each question.
