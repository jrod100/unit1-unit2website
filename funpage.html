        Death Road to Canada is a roguelike game meaning when someone dies its permanent and if your entire team dies you have to start from the very beginning making death highly punishing. The story is simple, in fact it’s almost non-existent, the zombie apocalypse happened, no one knows how, now knows why, no one...really cares the zombies are just kind of lame. Having nothing better to do hanging around in Florida your character hears a rumour that Canada is safe and sets off on a road trip, possibly with a buddy, and journey along the titular Death Road to Canada.

        The game has a very light hearted sense of humour with events including the usual scavenging for supplies but also including stranger events like dealing with buff bandits, deciding whether to eat gross looking healthy food at the risk of losing morale or trying to figure out who farted in the car.

        You can create your own custom characters or use randomly generated ones instead if you don’t feel like it or see a nice character combo you like. Besides changing a survivor’s appearance you can assign a trait and perk which affect their stats and what weapons they start with. Your stats include ones like strength and fitness as well as personality stats like attitude and loyalty and some support skills in medical and mechanical skill with morale also important to consider.

        Overall the game is very fun but be prepared to die often especially near the beginning. As you play you can earn zombo points which are used to upgrade and unlock new traits & perks so it’s best to play for a while and start upgrading the perks you like. Part of the fun is seeing what scenarios you end up in as there are multiple outcomes to each scenario and which are available depends on what stats your party has meaning no two playthroughs are the same. If you ever play Death Road to Canada try not to get demoralized by early deaths and try to enjoy the situations you team ends up in and try again; if you persevere you will make it to Canada. Finally when you make it to Canada and beat the game you can enjoy different game modes to replay the game over and over again.
