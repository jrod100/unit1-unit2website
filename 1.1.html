        <h3>1.1 IT in Modern Business</h3>
        <p>
            IT is used for many areas in modern business including communication among other areas, here I have described the uses and purposes that IT can fulfill in modern business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Communication is vital in a business and IT allows for both employees and clients to communicate with each other easily be it through email, phone calls or apps designed for communication like Slack. IT is also great for storing data both on computers and via the cloud which allows people to work from specific computers in a workspace or elsewhere when working from another location would prove useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Information management is made both easy and easily accessible via IT allowing information to be stored on a computer and accessed by employeeâ€™s when necessary. Overall IT has no singular purpose in modern businesses but serves multiple different purposes at once and helps make a business better. [1]
