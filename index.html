        <h3>1.0 About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is John Ross O’Driscoll. I go by either John or Ross though I prefer Ross since that’s what my family calls me to differentiate me from my Dad; we both have the first name John. I am currently 23 years old and my main hobby is playing video games with my favourite console being the PS4 and my current favourite game is Death Road to Canada a comedic, self styled 'Road Trip Simulator' about surviving the zombie apocalypse by driving to Canada.

        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p> 
            I went to college and university for game development where I learned a great deal about game developmentand how to code in C++ & CSharp. I am currently unemployed and was advised to try the Code Nation course by my work coach to both get some more work experience and to get a coding based qualification.

        <h3>My CodeNation experience</h3>
        <p>
            During my time on the Code Nation course I have enjoyed my time spent here and found the work relatively easy, most likely due to my previous experiences in education with team based tasks and the coding I learned from university.
