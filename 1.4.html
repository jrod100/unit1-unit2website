        <h3>1.4 Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>
            Working digitally is incredibly useful for a modern business but does not come without risks. Whilst working digitally is easy and helpful the information needs to be carefully protected as it is easier than ever to give out information that you shouldn’t or lose information from a cyberattack. Losing information to a cyberattack, besides looking bad and making clients lose confidence in you, is also dangerous for people as the loss of information could be about people’s private lives and having such information stolen is highly damaging.

            Working digitally can also risk losing information or work done if it is done via cloud saving. Uploading work done to somewhere that requires an internet connection can also leave you without a way to reach it if you lack a stable internet connection, so, to reduce the risk of this happening or losing the work entirely it is best to make copies of the work or download a copy so that it can be worked on without internet access. Downloading a copy doesn’t work too well for team based projects as every member of the team making their own document can lead to difficulty stitching the end result together and may not produce a desirable result.
