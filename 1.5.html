        <h3>1.5 IT Systems & Software</h3>
        <p>
            With the many different IT systems and software available it is important to make the right choice and that choice can be influenced by a variety of factors. Previous experience with technology would affect the decision of whether to use it again, if the previous experience was good I would be likely to use it again. Whether the tasks I’m set to do are to be done individually or as part of a group effort would influence the software I used as keeping in contact with the team becomes a priority in a group based task.

            I also prefer to use what is available on the machine I am using rather than download unknown programs online. The only exception I make to downloading software is when I’m either instructed to do so or otherwise recommended to do so by a colleague. Accessibility is also a factor for what software I’d use for example, I will use Google Docs over what is available on a machine like Microsoft Word as Google Docs can be accessed from any machine with an internet connection whereas with Word I would have to save the document to a memory stick to be able to work on it anywhere.
