            Trello has greatly helped in managing my tasks, both on this current project and on a previous team based work project. Placing all my needed tasks on to a Trello board has allowed me to tackle the project piece by piece and inform of what has been done, what needs doing and what tasks I’m currently working on.

            Github will be a useful tool as it will allow me to push a master version of whatever code I create to an online repository giving me another space to store and retrieve code from if the version from the machine I’m using becomes unusable. Github also allows for the sharing of code so it may be helpful for submitting the final version of the code if necessary; Github could also be useful for publishing my website when it’s ready to launch.

            Google Docs is also incredibly useful for making documentation as it is easily accessible from any machine with an internet connection and can be shared easily either with a copyable link or shared directly with someone via their email address. Google Docs also comes with a spell checker and other standard document features allowing for a lot of flexibility when creating a document for a variety of purposes.
